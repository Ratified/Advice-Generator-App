This is a solution for the Advice Generator App project from Frontend Mentor. It is a simple web application that generates random advice when the dice icon is clicked. The project is built using HTML, JavaScript, SASS, and the Fetch API.

## Description
The Advice Generator App is a web application that allows users to receive random advice by clicking on the dice icon. The app fetches advice from the Advice Slip API using the Fetch API and displays it on the screen. The user can click the dice icon multiple times to receive different advice each time.


The project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and SASS. It uses the Fetch API to make requests to the Advice Slip API and retrieve random advice. The generated advice is dynamically displayed on the webpage using JavaScript. The SASS stylesheet is used for styling the app, providing a visually appealing and responsive design.
